## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Error Handling Patterns

```python
# Before
result = await service.operation(data)

# After
try:
    result = await service.operation(data)
    logger.info(f"Operation completed successfully: {operation_id}")
    return result
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Invalid input for operation: {str(e)}")
    raise
except ConnectionError as e:
    logger.error(f"Connection error during operation: {str(e)}")
    # Implement retry logic or fallback
    return fallback_result
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Unexpected error during operation: {str(e)}")
    raise
```

### Security Patterns

```python
# Input validation
def _validate_input(data: str) -> None:
    if not isinstance(data, str):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a string")
    if len(data) > MAX_LENGTH:
        raise ValueError(f"Input too long (max {MAX_LENGTH} characters)")
    if re.search(DANGEROUS_PATTERNS, data):
        raise ValueError("Input contains potentially dangerous content")

# Input sanitization
def _sanitize_text(text: str) -> str:
    sanitized = text.replace('<', '&lt;').replace('>', '&gt;')
    sanitized = ''.join(char for char in sanitized if ord(char) >= 32)
    return sanitized.strip()
```

### Health Check Patterns

```python
async def health_check(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    try:
        health_status = {
            "status": "healthy",
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "components": {}
        }

        # Check each component
        for component_name, component in self.components.items():
            try:
                component_health = await component.health_check()
                health_status["components"][component_name] = component_health
                if component_health.get("status") != "healthy":
                    health_status["status"] = "degraded"
            except Exception as e:
                health_status["components"][component_name] = {
                    "status": "error",
                    "error": str(e)
                }
                health_status["status"] = "degraded"

        return health_status
    except Exception as e:
        return {
            "status": "error",
            "error": str(e),
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
