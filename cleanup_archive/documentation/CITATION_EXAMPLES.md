# üìö Citation System - How It Works (With Examples)

## üéØ **What the Citation System Actually Does**

The citation system automatically tracks sources and generates proper academic citations. Here's exactly how it works:

## üìñ **Example 1: Research Query**

### **User Input:**
```
"Research the impact of AI on healthcare"
```

### **What Happens Behind the Scenes:**

1. **System scrapes these sources:**
   - https://www.nature.com/articles/ai-healthcare-2024
   - https://www.nejm.org/ai-medical-diagnosis
   - https://www.who.int/ai-health-policy

2. **Automatic citation extraction:**
```python
# For each source, the system automatically extracts:
citation_1 = {
    "url": "https://www.nature.com/articles/ai-healthcare-2024",
    "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review",
    "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Johnson, A.", "Brown, M."],
    "publication_date": "2024-01-15",
    "journal": "Nature Medicine",
    "doi": "10.1038/s41591-024-00001-x"
}
```

3. **Generated citations in different formats:**

**APA Format:**
```
Smith, J., Johnson, A., & Brown, M. (2024). Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review. Nature Medicine, 30(2), 45-67.
```

**MLA Format:**
```
Smith, John, et al. "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare: A Comprehensive Review." Nature Medicine, vol. 30, no. 2, 2024, pp. 45-67.
```

## üìä **Example 2: Research Report with Citations**

### **Generated Report:**
```markdown
# Research Report: Impact of AI on Healthcare

## üîÑ **Example 4: Complete Research Workflow**

### **Step 1: User submits research query**
```python
research_results = await enhanced_research_service.research_topic(
    query="AI in healthcare",
    max_results=10
)
```

### **Step 2: System automatically:**
- Scrapes 10 relevant sources
- Extracts citations for each source
- Processes content for key findings
- Generates visualizations
- Creates comprehensive report

### **Step 3: User receives:**
```json
{
    "query": "AI in healthcare",
    "sources_analyzed": 10,
    "summary": "AI is transforming healthcare...",
    "key_findings": [
        "AI improves diagnostic accuracy by 23%",
        "Machine learning reduces readmissions by 15%"
    ],
    "citations": [
        {
            "id": "ref_001",
            "title": "Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare",
            "authors": ["Smith, J.", "Johnson, A."],
            "citations": {
                "apa": "Smith, J., & Johnson, A. (2024). AI in Healthcare...",
                "mla": "Smith, John, and Johnson, Alice. \"AI in Healthcare...\"",
