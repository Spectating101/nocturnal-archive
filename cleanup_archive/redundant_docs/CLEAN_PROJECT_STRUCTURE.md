# Nocturnal Archive - Clean Project Structure

## 🎯 **Current Status: MVP Complete - Clean Repository**

_Last Updated: August 13, 2024_

---

## 📁 **Project Structure**

### **Core Files**

- `README.md` - **Comprehensive documentation** (consolidated from multiple files)
- `simple_enhanced_api.py` - **Main API server** with research intelligence
- `launch_enhanced_system.py` - **System launcher** and entry point
- `requirements.txt` - **Python dependencies** for enhanced features
- `docker-compose.yml` - **Production-ready** container setup

### **Core Directories**

- `src/` - **Backend services** (research, paper, LLM, storage)
- `chatbot-ui/` - **Frontend interface** (Next.js/React)
- `tests/` - **Test files** for system components
- `deploy/` - **Deployment configuration** (Docker, monitoring)
- `scripts/` - **Utility scripts** and tools
- `legacy/` - **Legacy components** (if any)
- `simple-ui/` - **Alternative UI** (if needed)

### **Archive**

- `cleanup_archive/` - **All old files** moved here for safety
  - Old documentation files
  - Test scripts and demos
  - Redundant API files
  - Development artifacts

## 🚀 **Quick Start**

### **Launch the System**

```bash
# Launch enhanced system with demo
python launch_enhanced_system.py demo

# Launch interactive CLI mode
python launch_enhanced_system.py interactive

# Launch web interface
python launch_enhanced_system.py web
```

### **Start Backend API**

```bash
# Start the enhanced API server
python simple_enhanced_api.py
```

### **Start Frontend**

```bash
# Navigate to chatbot UI
cd chatbot-ui

# Install dependencies (if needed)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

## 🎉 **What's Been Accomplished**

### **✅ MVP Complete**

- **Complete research intelligence platform** with advanced analytics
- **Natural language interface** that understands research requests
- **Multi-LLM integration** with intelligent routing and fallbacks
- **Advanced visualizations** and data analysis capabilities
- **Production-ready backend** with comprehensive error handling
- **Modern frontend** with real-time updates and responsive design

### **✅ Repository Cleanup**

- **Consolidated documentation** into single comprehensive README
- **Moved redundant files** to cleanup_archive for safety
- **Clean project structure** with essential files only
- **Organized directories** for better maintainability

## 🚧 **Next Phase: Production Deployment**

### **High Priority**

- User authentication and management system
- API security (rate limiting, CORS, input validation)
- Production deployment infrastructure
- Monitoring and backup systems

### **Medium Priority**

- User workspaces and collaboration features
- Advanced search and filtering capabilities
- Research templates and workflows
- Performance optimization and scaling

## 📚 **Documentation**

All documentation has been consolidated into the main `README.md` file, which includes:

- Complete feature overview
- Technical architecture
- Usage instructions
- Development roadmap
- Achievement summary
