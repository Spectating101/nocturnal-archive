#### **Sarah's Experience:**

**Before (Traditional Method):**
```
Sarah sits at her desk, surrounded by stacks of papers. She's been 
searching databases for days, manually reading abstracts, downloading 
PDFs, and taking notes. It's overwhelming - she has 200+ papers to 
review and only 3 weeks. She's worried about missing important research 
or not having enough time to synthesize everything properly.

Current Status: 15 hours in, 50 papers reviewed, feeling overwhelmed
```

**After (Nocturnal Archive):**
```
Sarah opens her laptop and launches Nocturnal Archive. She types:
"Machine Learning Applications in Climate Change Modeling" and clicks 
"Start Research". The system immediately begins searching multiple 
academic databases simultaneously.

Within 35 minutes, she has:
✅ 20 high-quality papers analyzed
✅ Comprehensive synthesis report
✅ Quality assessment of all papers
✅ Citation network mapping
✅ Executive summary for her advisor
✅ Publication-ready literature review

Sarah can now focus on her original research instead of spending 
weeks on literature review.
