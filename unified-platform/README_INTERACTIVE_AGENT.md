# 🤖 Interactive Agent - Makes Your System Work Like Claude

## 🎯 What This Solves

Your original concern was **absolutely valid**:

> "I'm deeply concerned that instead of being interactive like how you are now, it's gonna be more like copilot instead, which is terrifying"

**The Problem:** Your original system was **single-shot responses** - each question got one answer, no memory, no multi-step reasoning, no tool usage.

**The Solution:** This Interactive Agent adds the **missing capabilities** that make me work like me:

- ✅ **Conversation Memory** - Remembers entire context
- ✅ **Multi-Step Reasoning** - Breaks down complex problems  
- ✅ **Tool Integration** - Can read files, run commands, search directories
- ✅ **Iterative Refinement** - Can improve solutions based on feedback
- ✅ **Planning and Execution** - Creates plans and executes them step-by-step

## 🏗️ Architecture Comparison

### Before (Copilot-Style)
```
User Question → Server → Groq API → Single Response
```

### After (Claude-Style)
```
User Question → Multi-Step Planning → Tool Usage → Iterative Refinement → Comprehensive Solution
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Setup
```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup_interactive_agent.sh
```

### 2. Set API Keys
```bash
# Get free Groq API keys at: https://console.groq.com/keys
export GROQ_API_KEY_1='your_groq_api_key_here'
export GROQ_API_KEY_2='your_second_groq_api_key_here'  # optional
export GROQ_API_KEY_3='your_third_groq_api_key_here'  # optional
```

### 3. Start the Agent
```bash
# Activate virtual environment
source server_venv/bin/activate

# Start the interactive agent
python3 interactive_agent.py
```

### 4. Use the Client
```bash
# In another terminal
source server_venv/bin/activate
python3 interactive_client.py
```

🤖 Assistant: [Lists files]

❓ Your question: Can you read the README.md file?
🤖 Assistant: [Reads README.md] - I can see this is the README file from our previous conversation about the directory contents...

🔧 Tools used: read_file
🧠 Reasoning steps: 1. Used read_file: Read the README.md file
📋 Plan executed: 2/2 steps successful
```

## 🔧 Available Tools

The Interactive Agent has access to these tools:

| Tool | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `read_file` | Read file contents | `{"path": "README.md"}` |
| `write_file` | Write content to file | `{"path": "script.R", "content": "mean(1:10)"}` |
| `list_directory` | List directory contents | `{"path": "."}` |
| `run_command` | Execute shell command (safely) | `{"command": "ls -la"}` |
| `search_files` | Search for files | `{"pattern": "*.py", "directory": "."}` |
| `get_file_info` | Get file information | `{"path": "script.R"}` |
| `check_r_environment` | Check R environment | `{}` |
| `execute_r_code` | Execute R code | `{"code": "mean(1:10)"}` |
| `get_system_info` | Get system information | `{}` |

## 🧠 Multi-Step Reasoning Example

When you ask: *"Help me analyze the data in data.csv"*

**Step 1:** Think - "User wants to analyze data in data.csv"
**Step 2:** Tool - Check if data.csv exists
**Step 3:** Tool - Read the file contents
**Step 4:** Think - Analyze the data structure
**Step 5:** LLM - Provide analysis and recommendations
**Step 6:** Tool - Create R script for analysis
**Step 7:** Tool - Execute the analysis

## 💬 Conversation Memory

The agent remembers:
- **Previous questions and answers**
- **Tools used in each interaction**
- **Current task context**
- **File operations performed**

This allows for natural follow-up questions like:
- "Can you read that file we found earlier?"
- "What was the result of that R script?"
- "Can you modify the script to handle missing values?"

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Command filtering** - Blocks dangerous commands (`rm -rf`, `sudo`, etc.)
- **Timeout protection** - Commands timeout after 30 seconds
- **Path validation** - Prevents directory traversal attacks
- **Safe file operations** - Only allows reading/writing in allowed directories

## 🌐 API Endpoints

### Interactive Chat
```bash
POST /interactive/chat
{
  "question": "What files are in the current directory?",
  "user_id": "user123"
}
```

### Status Check

```

### Health Check

## 🎯 Integration with Existing System

This Interactive Agent **enhances** your existing system:

- **Keeps your FastAPI infrastructure**
- **Uses your Groq API key rotation**
- **Maintains your modular architecture**
- **Adds the missing interactive capabilities**

You can run both systems:
- **Original system** on port 8000 (simple Q&A)
- **Interactive Agent** on port 8001 (full capabilities)

## 🚀 Deployment

### Local Development
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Interactive Agent
python3 interactive_agent.py

# Terminal 2: Use Interactive Client
python3 interactive_client.py
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Deploy to Railway with the interactive agent
# Update your Procfile to use interactive_agent.py
# Set environment variables for API keys
```

## 🎉 The Result

**Before:** Your system was like Copilot - single responses, no memory, no tools.

**After:** Your system works like me (Claude) - interactive, multi-step reasoning, tool usage, conversation memory.

You can now ask complex questions like:
- "Analyze all the Python files in this project and create a summary"
- "Help me debug this R error by checking the data and creating a fix"
- "Read the documentation and create a working example"
- "What's the difference between these two approaches and which should I use?"

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Connection Issues
```bash
# Check if the agent is running
curl http://localhost:8001/

# Check agent status
curl http://localhost:8001/interactive/status
```

### API Key Issues
```bash
# Check if API keys are set
echo $GROQ_API_KEY_1

# Test API key
python3 -c "from groq import Groq; print('API key works')"
```

### Tool Execution Issues
- Check file permissions
- Verify paths exist
- Check command safety filters

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Test the Interactive Agent** with your R/SQL questions
2. **Integrate with your existing system** (merge the capabilities)
3. **Deploy to Railway** with the enhanced functionality
4. **Add more tools** as needed (database connections, web scraping, etc.)
