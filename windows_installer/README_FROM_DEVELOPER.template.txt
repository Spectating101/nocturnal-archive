Hey there,

You're probably seeing a Windows security warning right now. Let me explain.

[What this is]
This is Cite Agent v1.3.6 - an AI research assistant I built for my thesis
at Yuan Ze University. It helps researchers find papers, analyze data, and
work with code files. Think of it as Cursor, but for research.

[Why the warning]
Windows shows "Unknown Publisher" because I haven't purchased a code signing
certificate ($200/year). For beta software built by grad students, that's
normal. The code is open-source and audited.

[How to verify it's safe]
  • Source code: https://github.com/[your-username]/Cite-Agent
  • PyPI package: https://pypi.org/project/cite-agent/1.3.6/
  • SHA256 checksum: [see VERIFY_CHECKSUMS.txt]

[How to install]
  1. Right-click CiteAgent-Setup-v1.3.6.exe
  2. Click "More info"
  3. Click "Run anyway"
  4. Follow the installer

You'll only see this warning once.

[What it does]
Once installed, you can:
  • Ask "Tesla revenue" → get real SEC data
  • Ask "find papers on transformers" → search academic databases
  • Ask "show me data.csv" → it reads and analyzes your files
  • Ask "where am i?" → it executes safe shell commands

All in a terminal interface. Fast, context-aware, and smart.

[Beta limitations]
  • 25 queries per day (during beta)
  • Auto-updates from PyPI
  • Telemetry enabled (for debugging)

[Thanks]
Thanks for testing this. Your feedback will make it better.
